            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Lord, now letteſt thou thy Servant depart in Peace, according to thy Word, For mine Eyes have ſeen thy Salvation,</hi>

            <p>FRom theſe Words I ſhall treat (through God's Aſſiſtance, and according to the Knowledge given me, <hi>O continue thy loving kindneſs to them that know thee: and thy Righteouſneſs to the upright in heart)</hi> of our contentment and willingneſs to Die, or depart from off this Earth.</p>
            <p>Why, Is there any need to perſwade or exhort People to a Willingneſs and Deſire to ſurrender back their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits unto the <hi>God who gave them?</hi> This ſeems to be but what is Natural and Reaſonable: Yet ſtill there is a reluctancy and backwardneſs in our Spirits to do this; becauſe the Spirit is conſcious of having offended God, and is afraid to meet with him Angry, or as <hi>a God that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aketh Vengeance.</hi> And therefore until this ſame God is perfectly Reconciled unto, and at Peace with her, and he is ſenſible and aſſured thereof, the Soul muſt needs be affraid and backward to come and appear before him.</p>
            <p>A diverſity is to be obſerved, when it is written, <hi>Into thine hand I commit my Spirit: Thou haſt redeemed me O Lord God of Truth.</hi> The Pſalmiſt doth not here ſay, Thou haſt Created me O Lord God of Truth. Though indeed this is true, yet that is not altogether ſo ſatisfying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Reaſon for him to willingly commit his Spirit into God's Hand, as the conſideration of his having <hi>Redeemed</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:153002:3"/> him is. Becauſe that <hi>by Nature we are the Children of Wrath as well as others,</hi> and we <hi>are ſhapen in Iniquity, and in Sin doth our Mother conceive us.</hi> So that until this ſame Sin and Iniquity (which is the Object of God's Hatred, Diſpleaſure and Puniſhment,) be done away, and we are <hi>Redeemed</hi> from it (for by his Redeeming us we are in a ſtate of Reconcilation again) as this is God's Act al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as well as of Creating us, we are not meet, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently there cannot be a Willingneſs upon good and true Grounds, to give up our Spirits unto God, or to ſay with old <hi>Simeon</hi> in the Text, <hi>Lord, now letteſt thou thy Servant depart in Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even this old <hi>Simeon,</hi> though he had already lived long on this Earth, yet he would not have been ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and deſirous to have departed out of it, unleſs he was to <hi>depart in Peace.</hi> Not to depart generally as moſt People do, in doubt, fear and trouble, but to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in Peace.</hi> If we could have our choice, and it were ſo in our power as to be Immortal here and never to Die; as for my part I ſhould deſire and pray unto God either to depart in Peace or not to depart at all: Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> as it is ſaid of the Son of Perdition, It would have been good for him if he had never been Born: ſo it may be here affirmed of thoſe who do not <hi>depart in Peace,</hi> It would be good for them not to depart, or not to dye at all. Not but that ſome may go off diſturbedly, and yet go off ſafely. The Soul may be ſometimes in a ſtate of Peace, and yet not be ſenſible thereof. <hi>Who feareth th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Lord, and obeyeth the voice of his Servant, and yet walketh in darkneſs, and have no light,</hi> Iſa. 50. 10. But when one hath true and aſſured Grounds of Departing in Peace, as <hi>Simeon</hi> here had, there one may pray and appeal to God for him to let our Soul depart from the Body.</p>
            <p>What were thoſe true and aſſured Grounds which <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> had of departing in Peace? They are contained in the following Verſe, <hi>For mine Eyes have ſeen thy Salvation.</hi> From hence it appears, that the true and aſſured Ground<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for which any one is willing and contented to Dye, is <hi>Becauſe he hath ſeen the Salvation of God;</hi> or, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting our Spirit into the Hand of God, is, <hi>Becauſe he hath Redeemed us.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:153002:3"/>
            <p> Now to ſee the Salvation of God, or for God to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us, do amount to near one and the ſame thing: As it is written, <hi>The Kingdom of God cometh not with Obſervation,</hi> (in the Margent there it is, with outward ſhew) <hi>Neither ſhall they ſay, Lo here, or Lo there, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>From what hath been afore written it appears, that there are three things eſpecially which upon good and true grounds, can make any one contented willing and deſirous to Dye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> When one hath <hi>ſeen the Salvation of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> When the <hi>Lord God of truth hath Redeemed us:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When one <hi>hath Glorified God on Earth, and finiſbed the Work which he gave us to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was <hi>Revealed unto</hi> Simeon <hi>by the Holy Ghoſt, that he ſhould not ſee Death until he had ſeen the Lord's Chriſt. And he came by the Spirit into the Temple, and when his Parents brought in the Child Jeſus to do for him after the Cuſtom of the Law. then took he him in his Arms and Bleſſed God and ſaid, mine Eyes have ſeen thy Salvation.</hi> So that <hi>Simeon</hi> his ſeeing the Salvation of God was ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the Fleſh. But ſince the fullneſs of time is over and paſt we cannot now ſee him in the Fleſh here on Earth, yet we may ſee him in his Grace
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:153002:6"/> and Revelation. But chiefly to ſee <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, the Power of God, and the Wiſdom of God, is with the Eyes of our Underſtanding being enlightened and turned inwards to ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> within us. <hi>Little Children of whom I travail in Birth till Chriſt be formed in ye;</hi> And ſo to have <hi>Chriſt</hi> formed in us, this is to ſee the Salvation of God. Now this is a work of time and ſucceſſion as it is of forming the Infant, in the Womb. To have or ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> formed within us, is the Buſineſs and Work of our whole Life here on Earth, which the Preaching and Miniſtry of the word doth help unto. And when once <hi>Chriſt</hi> is throughly formed within us, and we ſee the Salvation of God, then we may be well contented, willing and Deſirous to dye for this Reaſon. For as when the Chick ſees the <hi>Kite</hi> or <hi>Hawk</hi> which would devour it, if ſhe can run under the <hi>Hens</hi> wings, then ſhe is ſafe; For as the <hi>Hen</hi> was at firſt Inſtrumental to give it Life and Being, ſo it will ſtill preſerve it. Even ſo by ſeeing the Lord's <hi>Chriſt</hi> who is the <hi>Prince of Life</hi> and <hi>the Salvation of God,</hi> the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soul who is in Covenant with him runs, and makes unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who promiſes and performs it alſo: <hi>He ſhall cover thee with his Feathers, and under his Wings ſhalt thou truſt,</hi> Pſal 91. 3. and <hi>gathereth his Children together even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings.</hi> Here let Death and the Devil come and deſtroy that Soul if they can; <hi>Chriſt</hi> is greater in power and might<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Forſamuch then as the Children were partakers of Fleſh and Blood he alſo himſelf took part of the ſame, that he through Death might Deſtroy him that had the Power of Death that is the Devil: And deſtroy them who through fear of Death were all their life time Subject to Bondage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we are firſt ſaved from Sin and Guilt, then w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To be patient to Live and willing to Dye is the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and diſpoſition of Soul which I deſire and would endeavour at; And this my willingneſs to dye ſhould not proceed out of a Melancholy temper: Like <hi>Jonah</hi> in an Angry Mood who would have the Lord to take his Life from him, <hi>For it was better for him to Dye than to Live:</hi> only forſooth becauſe he was diſpleaſed at the time that the Lord did not deſtroy <hi>Nineveh,</hi> according to the word which he had Preached; But this was only a pettiſh hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of his: And ſo others at this day upon a ſudden Affliction and Vexation are forthwith weary of the world and call to Death to come and eaſe them of the preſent Burthen, Trouble, Grief or Uneaſineſs.

            <p>The ſecond true and aſſured ground of a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, willingneſs and deſire to dye is, when the Lord God of truth hath Redeemed us. <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth, Thy word is truth.</hi> And ſo the ſame God, that doth Sanctifie his People through his truth, doth alſo Redeem them through his truth, or by his word of truth. When we are once throughly Redeemed and Sanctified by the truth of God, then we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our Spirits into the hand of God. For then theſe Spirits of ours are Redeemed and Sanctified from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Defilement and Corruption they had from the Body, and from the things of this Earth; Then the Spirit returns to God again the ſame as it was when
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:153002:7"/> he gave it. <hi>The Temple of God is Holy; which Temple ye are.</hi> And ſo God expects that that Spirit which he Created Holy (for ſo it was before it is defiled with the Body of Death) ſhould be kept and preſerved Holy; but chiefly it ſhould be Sanctified, that is, made Holy, juſt as it comes to be ſurrendred and given back unto God. Every Like loves its Like, and an Holy God loves an Holy Soul. The Scripture expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly affirmeth it, <hi>Without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord;</hi> which implyes the contrary, that with Holineſs, or when the Soul is endued or clothed with Holineſs, it ſhall then certainly ſee the Lord to its endleſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Rejoycing</p>
            <p>The great and principal Buſineſs we have to do here on this Earth, and as we are going off from it (which we do continually as ſoon as we are Born) is to dye to Sin, <hi>(I dye Daily,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle) and to get Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ingrafted into the Soul. As we are day after day approaching nearer and nearer unto the Grave, here let us examin and prove our ſelves, whether we are yet more Dead unto Sin, and have Holineſs yet more ingrafted into our Souls; Whether as our deſires grow more languid and unaffected as to Creature Comforts and to creature enjoyments (by having had them over and over ſo often already) So the ſame deſires are more from Sin and Vanity, and the more thirſt after God: And after the Enjoyment of him in his Kingdom ſo as to cry out from the real ſenſe, bent and inclination of our Souls, <hi>As the Hart panteth after the Water Brooks, ſo panteth my Soul after thee O God!</hi> When we can ſay in truth and ſeelingly within our ſelf, there is none upon Earth I deſire beſides thee. And when in old Age we cannot taſt what we Eat or what we Drink, <hi>When the Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Houſe ſhall tremble and thoſe that look out of the Windows are Darkened; when the Graſhopper ſhall be a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and deſire ſhall fail; My Fleſh and my Heart faileth,</hi> if then God <hi>is the ſtrength of our Heart and our Portion for ever.</hi> For ſo the right Conſequence is, and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſhould be uſed accordingly: That as our outward Man decays day by day, ſo we ſhould be more renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:153002:8"/> in the inward Man. As the day approaches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually nearer and nearer when we ſhall outwardly go off from this Earth, the more we ſhould be Redeemed from the Earth; that is, we ſhould be Redeemed from the Evil and Defilement, and Corruption of this Earth, before we can upon Aſſured grounds commit our Spirit into the hand of God.</p>
            <p>Beſides this of being Redeemed from our vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and from the Corruption of our Nature, and of being <hi>without Guile and Fault before the Throne of God;</hi> The chief and eſpecial Redemption is that which was wrought and accompliſhed by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who in <hi>his Love and Pity hath Redeemed them, and he bare them and he carried them all the days of old</hi> Iſa. 63. 9. <hi>Even Jeſus which delivered us from the wrath to come.</hi> Who bought us with a price and purchaſed us with his own Blood. As God the Father Redeemed and brought up the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> Whereby he was in a more eſpecial manner their God, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer hath a right in the Redeemed: Even ſo God by his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath Redeemed Mankind from Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Aegypt from the Slavery and Bondage of Sin and Satan and Death. <hi>Chriſt hath Redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us.</hi> And it was this Redemption wrought and accompliſhed by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who was of the ſeed and linage of <hi>David,</hi> whom the Scripture therefore calls the Son of <hi>David,</hi> which <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of by the Spirit and had reſpect unto, when he ſaid, <hi>Into thine hand I commit my Spirit, Thou haſt Redeemed me O Lord God of truth.</hi> To purſue the very ſame Reaſoning here as is in <hi>Acts 2 25, 30. 32. For David ſpeaketh concerning him, Thou haſt Redeemed me O Lord God of truth, For being a Prophet and knowing that God had ſworn with an Oath to him,</hi> (In fulfilling of which he is here fitly called the Lord God of truth) <hi>That of the fruit of his loins, according to the Fleſh he would raiſe up Chriſt to ſit on his Throne</hi> and to Redeem Mankind by him: He ſeeing this before ſpake of the Redemption of Chriſt, Thou haſt Redeemed me O Lord God of truth: It being the uſual ſtile of Prophecies to ſpeak of that as alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:153002:8"/> paſt which is to come. Whereby is ſhewn forth the immutable truth of the Eternal God, for what he hath decreed in his Eternal counſel and purpoſe, it is as certain as if it was already paſt and fulfilled. <hi>As Abraham ſaw his day and was glad,</hi> ſo here <hi>David</hi> ſaw his day and was glad. And truly well they might for ſaith the Apoſtle in the Perſons of the Regenerate, for we were by Nature Children of wrath as well as others: So that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath alſo; And then both of them might well be glad to foreſee by Faith this <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> who was to Redeem them from the wrath to come.</p>
            <p>The word, Redemption, is a relative term, and doth preſuppoſe captivity, thraldom, or the being ſold; from all which Redemption doth loſe and ſet free again. And ſo this <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> travelled <hi>in the greatneſs of his ſtrength and was mighty to ſave,</hi> he led Captivity Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that is, he led even Sin and the Devil Captive, which before did lead and hold People in captivity, who from their inſlaving Nature are here expreſſed not to be only Captivating Men, but they are Captivity it ſelf in the Abſtract: Intimating thereby, that theſe who are under the power of Satan, (For ſo the Scripture expreſſes it, to turn from Darkneſs unto Light, and from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Satan unto God) they are in the utmoſt Captivity, yea worſe than that is of thoſe that are bound with Chains and Fetters, although theſe are ſeen but the others are to be underſtood and felt by ſuch who are in the <hi>Bond of Iniquity.</hi> Acts 9. 23. For Sin, iniquity and luſt are as a Chain or Bond, which doth hold and hamper People therein, that they know not yea, they cannot without <hi>Chriſt</hi> that ſtrengtheneth them, get out and extricate themſelves from it. Now as <hi>Jeſus</hi> doth ſave his People from their ſins, he doth in this ſenſe <hi>Preach deliverance to the Captives, and ſet at liberty them that are bound,</hi> and Redeem <hi>them who for their Iniquities had ſold themſelves,</hi> Iſa. 50. 1. Even unto the Devil and Hell, the place of Damnation and eternal Puniſhment. <hi>And having ſpoiled Principalities and Powers, he made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them.</hi> The Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:153002:9"/> and Powers here meant are the Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the other World, the Powers of Darkneſs and the Devil who is the Prince of the Power of the Air; Here <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to have ſpoiled the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality and Power of the Devil, which he hath done to ſuch as are Chriſts, for over ſuch the Devil hath no Principality or Power, and triumphed over them in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo that ſince he hath Redeemed ranſomed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved us from all the evil and terrible things of the future and inviſible world which we immediatly enter into by Death; And then we may be willing contended and deſirous to dye, when we are aſſured before hand that God hath by his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> Redeemed us from <hi>all the Power of the Enemy</hi> and from all the evil things of the other World; So that nothing there ſhall in the leaſt hurt us, much leſs torment and make us miſerable.</p>
            <p>And thus theſe two Expreſſions, <hi>Lord letteſt thou thy Servant depart in peace, according to thy word, for mine Eyes have ſeen thy Salvation;</hi> Into <hi>thine hand I commit my Spirit, thou haſt Redeemed me O Lord God of truth,</hi> do fall in and meet together near to ſame ſenſe and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning even according to the requiring and earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the reaſonable Creature, who would fain not be miſerable hereafter. The one ſignifies to be ſaved and the other to be Redeemed from the wrath to come, which are one and the ſame thing. The conſequence again is certain, if we are ſaved from the wrath to come, then we ſhall enjoy the Bleſſedneſs <hi>(come ye Bleſſed of my Father)</hi> to come as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever was not found written in the Book of Life, was caſt into the Lake of fire:</hi> So it may be reaſoned on the other ſide, whoſoever ſhall not be caſt into the Lake of fire ſhall enter into Life, ſo that if we are ſaved and Redeemed from the Lake of fire, we ſhall enter into life and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſs. Now ſeeing that the decree of God ſtandeth on this wiſe, we may upon very good reaſons not only ſay ſo contentedly, but alſo really aſſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame in our minds, being contented willing and deſirous from the ground of our heart that it ſhould be ſo, Lord now letteſt thou thy Servant depart in peace,

And ſo according as there are diverſities of gifts and differences of operations in People, and as one glorifies God by his Death one way and another, another: So there are divers ways and different manners of Glorifying God according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral caſes, circumſtances, conditions, or rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeveral gifts and endowments in Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>By what Death he ſhould Glorifie God. Now in Death there is bitterneſs and hardſhip (it being the hardeſt and moſt terrible thing in the world to dye) from hence we gather that when we poor Creatures ſubmit or ſubject our ſelves to hardſhip or difficulty either in obedience to the Commandments of God, or according to the decree and appointment of God, this is a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying God, and God is Glorifyed thereby: When <hi>Chriſt</hi> his only begotten Son came to taſte of that bitter Cup, he ſaith, <hi>Now is my Father glorified, but for this hour came I into the World.</hi> In the divers kinds of Death ſome are more ſhameful and painful then others, as to be hanged on a Gallows or Gibbet, or to be nailed on the Croſs is more ſhameful and painful, than to dye of a common Diſeaſe in our Bed; yet from hence it follows that as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord and forerunner was made a curſe of God for us, as curſed <hi>is every one that hangeth on a Tree;</hi> And as himſelf, who <hi>ſuffered for us, leaving us an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps,</hi> did herein undergo both the pain and the ſhame, therefore the more painful and ſhameful the Death is (provided always that it be in a way of duty, and in obedience unto or keeping the Commandments of God) So much the more God is glorified thereby. Which conſideration if it be throughly weighed in our minds,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:153002:10"/> ſhould make us earneſtly deſire Martyrdom and not to be afraid of or decline from it. Hence it follows that to take up the Croſs, yea to take up the Croſs dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

In like manner the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:153002:16"/> true Servants of God may be diſtinguiſhed from the barren profeſſors of the Goſpel, for as theſe may be likened to ſuch Trees only that have leaves on them, but as for the former ſort <hi>By their fruits you ſhall know them.</hi> The firſt ſort do ſhew <hi>out of a good converſation his works with meekneſs of wiſdom;</hi> and the Goſpel in them bringeth forth fruit, and bringeth forth herbs meet for whom it is dreſſed; ſo they bring forth fruits meet for him by whom they are dreſſed, and that is God; for by his Word and Spirit they are dreſſed. The word and ſpirit is like putting dung unto ſoil, ſo theſe do prune, dreſs and manure the hearts of people, and <hi>gather out the ſtones thereof,</hi> Iſa. 5. 2. A <hi>ſtony heart will he take away and give them an heart of fleſh,</hi> and all this is to bring forth fruits unto God, And as is aforeſaid that Hypocritical outward Worſhippers do rather diſhonour than glorifie God: ſo do thoſe profeſſors who bring forth wild Grapes inſtead of Grapes; or who inſtead of being a <hi>Nobel vine and wholly a right ſeed,</hi> are of a ſudden <hi>turned into a degenerate plant of a ſtrange vine.</hi> So contrariwiſe when thoſe who are indeed the Servants of the moſt high God, do indeed bring forth good grapes, and good fruits, ſuch as in truth are becoming the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> theſe again do as much glorifie God as the other ſort do diſhonour him. This appears from that aforecited Scripture, <hi>Herein is my Father glorified that ye bear much fruit, ſo ſhall ye be my Diſciples.</hi> Intimating there by that people may have the name of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but they are not ſo indeed unleſs they bear much fruit. But this is yet more evident from the following Scripture, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> For the good works or good fruits of his Servants do occaſion God to be glorified, that is to be well thought off, and well ſpoken off, and for praiſe and honour to be aſcribed unto him. To purſue here the like reaſoning which <hi>Moſes</hi> doth in Deut. 4. 6. 7, 8. So in this caſe ſtrangers and thoſe people who as yet know not God, will be apt to think, and ſay, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf muſt be a very Good and Wiſe and Holy and

            </p>
            <p>For to be Godly is to be like unto God, and to be like unto God is to be Godly. And ſo to do good is a true reſemblance and likeneſs unto the God-Head in that <hi>He did good, giving us Rain from Heaven,</hi> and it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The good works and good fruits which appear forth through any Man or Woman are the actings of God through his Creatures: For 'tis not ſo much they but <hi>Chriſt</hi> who dwelleth in them that doth this or that good thing; and therefore it is meet and right that God ſhould have the Glory and Honour of it, <hi>Which cauſeth through us thankſgiving unto God, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of this ſervice, not only ſupplieth the want of the Saints but is abundant alſo by many thankſgivings unto God,</hi> 2 Cor. 9. 11, 12, As indeed ſuch people who are Spiritually knowing, when they ſee any good works, they do thereupon glorify our father which is in Heaven; for he is indeed the author and original of them, and
